# `r3d`

Routines for fast, geometrically robust clipping operations and analytic volume/moment computations 
over polytopes in 2D and 3D (as well as experimental ND). This software forms the kernel for an exact 
general remeshing scheme. Also includes physically conservative voxelization 
(volume sampling) of polytopes to a Cartesian grid in 2D and 3D.

As described in 
[Powell & Abel (2015)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999115003563) and
[LA-UR-15-26964](la-ur-15-26964.pdf). For information about the API itself, see
[LA-UR-15-26964](la-ur-15-26964.pdf). The now-deprecated version of the code used for 
[Powell & Abel (2015)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999115003563) 
lives in `deprecated`.

### Features:

- Robustly clip polytopes against planes.

- Compute volumes and moments over polytopes using the optimal recursive method of
[Koehl (2012)](https://www.computer.org/csdl/trans/tp/2012/11/ttp2012112158.pdf).

- Voxelize 2D and 3D polytopes onto a Cartesian grid by calculating the exact coordinate moments
  of the intersections between the polytope and each underlying grid cell.

- Utility functions for orientation tests, box initialization, conversion between polyhedral
  representations, and more.

- A set of rigorous unit-tests, located in `tests`. These tests also serve as examples of how to
  use `r3d`. 

- All declarations and documentation are located in `r3d.h`, `v3d.h`, `r2d.h`, and `v2d.h`.
